    Pre assigned entities which all include backend and frontend functionalities:

        eg 1. Products and retailers
        eg 2. Admin, boss and monitor pages
        eg 3. Users and userpages

    additionally styles, components, state handling etc. is planned and implemented partly together. Atleast centralized as much as possible.

        Trello cards to assing tasks
        1 week cycle
        Cards include used hours and author
